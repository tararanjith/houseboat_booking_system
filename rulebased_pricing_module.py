    Calculates the total price for a stay based on simple rules 
    (season, weekend) and adds a platform fee. This is the recommended
    approach for the mini-project given time constraints.

    Args:
        base_price_per_night (float): The owner's base price for the boat per night.
        check_in_date_str (str): Check-in date as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Can come from user input.
        check_out_date_str (str): Check-out date as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Can come from user input.
        platform_fee_percent (float): Platform fee as a percentage (e.g., 10 for 10%).

    Returns:
        float: The total calculated final price for the stay, including fees.
               Returns None if dates are invalid or check_out is not after check_in.
